If you use the code, we would appreciate it if you cite the paper above.

Note that this is research code.  The authors will not provide extensive support.

RUNNING THE CODE:

1. Start Matlab and type "compile" to compile all needed binaries.

2. Run "demo.m" to run the trained cuboid detector on an example image.
